# Adaptive Delta Modulation Example

Final project for Communication Systems
Made by Jarod Ma

## Description

A project that show the effects of modifying the frequency and delta value when performing:

1. Staircase Approximation / Quantization
2. Adaptive Delta Modulation.

The results will be shown in a graphical chart; the slope-overload distortion and granular noise will be included in the chart via filling between lines.

## How to run the file

Download the files and extract them to a folder, then open index.html with a Javascript compatible browser like Google Chrome.
